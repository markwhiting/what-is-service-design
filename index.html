			<h1>First, the basics:</h1>
			<p>Imagine two different auto repair shops &mdash; both can quickly and cheaply fix your car. At the end of the day, the one with a better-designed service will provide you with the best experience, and you’ll be more likely to recommend it to friends and family.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Services are intangible goods; and just like cars and websites, they can be well designed.</li>
				<li>Because of this intangibility, people are less aware of services, and often overlook the quality of their design.</li>
			</ol>
